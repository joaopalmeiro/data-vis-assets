These assets may coincide with code snippets, color palettes, axis designs, among others.\n\nThe main goal is to gather, in one place, all the material, properly identified with the sources, that serves as a catalog (no pun intended) for great ideas out there and that can serve as inspiration for the future.\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback, feel free to create an issue [here](https://github.com/joaopalmeiro/data-vis-assets/issues). I hope this repository/page can also be useful for you! \ud83d\udcc8\n"}});
